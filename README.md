# Mapping Police Interactions App 

(Official name TBA)

CISC499 Undergraduate Project developped by Joshua Chai-Tang, Anthony Rios and Aidan Turnbull

Supervisor: Catherine Stinson

# Project Proposal

## Problem Description

Our task is to develop a mobile app requested by a community group that experiences police harassment. This community has had frequent problems with racist police officers, such as officers excessively patrolling their neighborhood and bothering them at their own houses. Because of this, the community has requested our help to make an app that will allow them to tackle some of these issues. The idea the community group described is similar to the Green Book app in the new season of Dear White People. This project aims to go one step above simple app development, by tackling racial, ethical, and social justice issues as well.

## Proposed Solution

To handle this problem, we plan to develop a mobile app that allows users to anonymously submit descriptions of problematic police interactions. The app would then be able to organize and map out these incidents in order to identify concerning trends in police behaviour. Information regarding these incidents and trends will be made publically available, limited to a degree that ensures the safety of individuals using the app. This app will make it possible to collect empirical data on discriminatory practices, which is a critical component of exposing injustice within the police force and holding officers accountable to their actions.

## Implementation

Data security is a top priority in the development of this app. For the safety of the community, it is important that the identities of users are kept strictly confidential (unless they choose to post it publicly). The app itself will make use of modern encryption and cybersecurity methods to ensure the privacy of users is respected at all times. Most of the app's features will be determined based on the requirements given by the community group. Development will involve creating a series of early prototypes and modifying them over time based on feedback from this community group. The target platform for this app is both android and iOS. The app will be built for both platforms from a single codebase using Python3 and the Kivy framework. Documentation for Kivy can be found here: https://kivy.org/#home.
